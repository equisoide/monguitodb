# monguitodb
Utility to perform CRUD operations over the localStorage, sessionStorage, or any object implementing the Storage Interface defined by the W3C.

This library was inspired by MongoDB, and some of its functions are syntactically similar to how they are in Mongo, with some differences and limitations.

NOTE: This utility works synchronously.

## Installation

Download the [minified library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equisoide/monguitodb/master/build/monguito-db.min.js) (which is under 10KB) and include it into your html. Alternatively you can include the [development version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equisoide/monguitodb/master/build/monguito-db.js).

```html
<script src="monguito-db.min.js"></script>
```
